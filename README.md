%In this study, C-band RADARSAT-2 imagery was utilized. (Please note that this data is not subject to copyright restrictions; therefore, I will provide the power values of its components following Freeman-Durden decomposition.) 

%A T3 matrix generated from the May 9, 2019 image ('T3_0509.mat') is provided for code testing.

%Step1: Involved preprocessing the data in SNAP 9.0 and generating the coherence matrix (T3). 

%Step 2: The T3 matrix was imported into MATLAB, where the double-bounce, volume scattering power, and surface scattering power for each image were computed using a combination of Freeman-Durden three-component decomposition and non-negative eigenvalue decomposition (refer to Section 4.1 of the paper).

%Step 3: These results were integrated into a three-dimensional matrix (line*column*3), yielding the file 'freeman_pspdpv_date.mat'.
